=eMystery
Walking to your destination you see a formally dressed man standing in a corner. Upon closer inspection he appears to be missing a shoe. You catch him staring at you.{repast: His otherwise perfectly white shirt is stained with what must have been tomato sauce under his chin.}
->->
=eDeath
   A gaggle of goth kids bickering in English get in your way. Must have gotten lost on their way to the catacombs. You can see skulls in their faces.
   ->->
=eFlight
    The gallery grows suddenly darker. Looking up, you notice that the skylight to the gallery has been covered by an entire flock of pidgeons. {dream > grounded: It feels like you are looking up from the underworld.}
    The pidgeons fly out of view.
    ->->
=ePrey
    As you move through the gallery you see a small white mouse conspiratorially peeking over the top of one of the paintings. It is staring at me?
