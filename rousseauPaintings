#InkGallery: Surprised
You approach Roussea's <i>Surprised!</i> You see a tiger, {illuminated by a flash of lightning|in the midst of a raging gale}{themes ? prey:, preparing to pounce on its prey}.

 * This tiger seems not like a tiger... #InkGallery: Surprised Tiger
    Even though Roussea never visited the tropics, he meticulously created his {themes ? paradise:
            Eden
        -else:
            jungle
        } scenes by layering green upon green in every conceivable shade.
        ** It's like an absinthe dream of a jungle -> imaginary_tiger
        ** Absinthe...what's that like?
            It's probably not the same today. -> absinthe
 * What jungle could this be? #InkGallery: Surprised Foliage
    It must be Mogul India. There was an obsession with India at the time. Even Delacroix painted tigers.
        ~themes += mystery
        **Do tigers kill people?

        ** (unreal)This is a bit too fantastical. I'm sure a Tiger wouldn't hunt in a torrential thunderstorm{repast: unlike that creepy{repast.Lion2: standing} lion from the other painting.}.
            ~dream--
            It must be a dream. #InkGallery: Surprised Rain
            
 
 * (imaginary_tiger) The tiger is floating and on the ground at the same time. How can that be?
   The tiger's prey is beyond the edge of the canvas.
    ** It's stalking a person! Is it me?
    ~themes += prey
    -> human
    ** This is a bit too unreal.

Roussea was no Bohemian. He exhibited in the Salon de Independent, maybe they drank absinthe, there when it was still legal.

The Repast of the Lion

Lush greenery, colorful flowers, and a calm sunset all frame a lion â€“ feasting on a leopard as he stares back at you.
