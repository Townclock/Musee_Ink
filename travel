  Gallery One is a favourite. The post-impressionist Rousseau's "La Charmeuse de Serpents" dominates the room. Toulouse-Lautrec's Moulin Rouge works occupy and brighten the far corner. A small crowd gathers to ponder the black Eve in her garden of Eden.

    {fear == terrified: You run through the crowded streets of Paris trying to get to safety. Overhead, the gargoyles and grotesques of Paris mock you. You run through the lobby of your hostel and upstairs to your room. You lock yourside inside. Feeling trapped still, you open a window to the evening sky. The moon is out and shining through the window. You collapse into your bed, trembling, but safe.->END}
    {time > 180: You leave the gallery and walk away from the museum without incident. You go on to live a full and happy life. ->END}
