* {foyer_stories} [Talk to the receptionist]
  The receptionist, unmistakably Parisienne, greets you warmly.
  
  "Bien venue a la MusÃ©e. Avez-vous billets?"
  
    **  (email)"Yes, I have this email."
        She raises a bar code scanner and beckons you to approach. Beep. A small machine on the desk prints out a sticker. She {nametag:picks up the pamphlet on the desk}{nametag == 0:grabs a pamphlet} and places the sticker on the back. 
        "This is your pass for the day. It's got a map inside, but the place is small so you might not need it."

    ** (nametag)Her nametag. . .
        You take a look at her chest and examine the nametage she is wearing. "Freya" it says. That's not a very French name.
        "I'm sorry honey. I can't do this. I'll wait for you in the foyer." An older woman steps up to the receptionist and places a pamphlet on the desk. She smiles at you on her way to the way bench by the foyer entrance.

        Freya looks like she is about to say something and then gives up. 
        "I'm sorry about that." She says. "Ticket?"
