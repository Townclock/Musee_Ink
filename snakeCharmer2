You stand before Rousseau's Snake Charmer...

Standing next to you is a little girl, holding the hand of her mother, as they gaze up at the painting. "Look, mommy...do you see the birds?" #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer
- (top)
 * I see no birds. It's a painting of a woman. #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer
   Yes, but she's in a garden of Eden, a paradise. Surely, there are other creatures that fly. Where would birds be? You scan the painting again. 
        ** Search the night sky... -> sky
        ** Search the ground... ->ground
            Of course, I see the spoonbill. -> ground
        ** Look in the trees...
            -> all_birds
 * Could there be birds in the trees? #InkGallery: Trees
    Ah, I see...the night owl peers through the darkness. It's eyes following me like prey.
        ~themes += prey
        **Could there be others?
            Yes, of course. It's a jungle scene. There must be other birds. Birds that prey at night.

        ** (ground)Of course, I see the spoonbill, but she said "birds".
            I keep looking. #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer
            -> top
 
 * (sky) I see the moon, pale and low in the sky, but I see no birds in flight. #InkGallery: Sky
    ~themes += flight
    Only an owl may fly at night.
    ** Where would the owl be, if not in flight?
    -> all_birds
    ** It's like a dream.
    -> all_birds

 * (trees) The trees are dark and deep, lovely.

    **I see the owl, but where are the other birds? #InkGallery: Trees

    ->all_birds
    **Ahh, I see them! The parrots...they look happy, content and safe. We have a bird on the ground, the spoonbill. There is the owl. And our love birds, the parrots.

    You see the spoonbill, and the owl. Look closely...just to the left of the owl.
    **I see the parrots!
    ->all_birds

Look closely in the trees. There, you not only see the owl, who represents knowledge, but also a pair of parrots, who mate for life. #InkGallery: Trees

Am I like a mouse in the night? Or like the parrots, happily coupled? #InkGallery: Parrots
