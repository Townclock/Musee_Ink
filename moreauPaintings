Les ChimÃ¨res
Gustave Moreau

It's a large and unfinished forest scene. There's a lot of detail, but it's difficult to make out from afar... #InkGallery: Chimeras

* (Overall) [Lean in to scan the image.]
    You lean in and realize that the forest contains dozens of nude women <i>lounging</i> amongst creatures as if unaware of the impending danger. #InkGallery: Chimeras Overall
        ** [Zoom into the center.]
        Your eyes dart toward the center where you spot a woman confidently riding on a winged chimera in complete control of her destiny. Her gusto rubs off on you{B: and, somehow, all the fear immediately exits your body}. #InkGallery: Chimeras Winged
        <- flyingBeasts
        ~fear--
        Still feeling {dream}, but now {fear}, you decide to turn your attention elsewhere. 

        ** [Zoom into the bottom.]
        Your eyes dart toward the bottom where you spot a few women dreamily staring off into the distance. Although a serpent creeps among them, they remain calm. #InkGallery: Chimeras Women
        <- creepingBeasts
        ~fear--
        {
            - B:
                Now feeling {fear} and {dream}, you decide to turn your attention elsewhere. 
            - else:
                Still feeling {fear}, but now {dream}, you decide to turn your attention elsewhere.
        }
* (Unfinished) Why is it unfinished? #InkGallery: Chimeras Unfinished
    Moreau abandoned the work shortly after his mother's passing to work on a much darker piece that dipicts the fact that DEATH is coming for us all.

 * Faces
    Oedipus has been asked his riddle and is obviously thinking very hard to figure out the answer.
    Looking at the sphinx's eyes and posture you can tell that she's just waiting for him to screw up so that she can eat him.

    # InkGallery: Oedipus Butterfly
    In Greek myth butterflies are associated with the soul. A soul leaving an urn. Perhaps a little heavy handed.

 Will Moreau's Oedipus rise to the challenge and survice?
  {themes? safety:
 # InkGallery: Oedipus FigTree
 The bay tree behind Oedipus suggests that he will hold to virtue and succeed in his goal.
 }
 {themes? temptation:
 # InkGallery: Oedipus FigTree
 The fig tree, Christian symbol of temptation and sin would say otherwise.
