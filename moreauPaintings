You examine the painting:

It's a large and unfinished forest scene. There's a lot of detail, but it's difficult to make out from afar... #InkGallery: Chimeras

* (A) [Lean in to scan the image.]
    You lean in and realize that the forest contains dozens of nude women <i>lounging</i> amongst creatures as if unaware of the impending danger. #InkGallery: Chimera
        ** [Zoom into the center.]
        Your eyes dart toward the center where you spot a woman confidently riding on a winged chimera in complete control of her destiny. Her gusto rubs off on you{B: and, somehow, all the fear immediately exist your body}.

        ** [Zoom into the bottom.]
        Your eyes dart toward the bottom where you spot a few women dreamily staring off into the distance. Although a serpent creeps among them, they remain calm.

* (B) Why is it unfinished? #InkGallery: Les Chimères B
    Moreau abandoned the work shortly after his mother's passing to work on a much darker piece that dipicts the fact that DEATH is coming for us all.
