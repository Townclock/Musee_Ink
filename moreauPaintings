Les Chimères
Gustave Moreau

It's a large and unfinished forest scene. There's a lot of detail, but it's difficult to make out from afar... #InkGallery: Chimera

* (A) [Lean in to scan the image.]
    You lean in and realize that the forest contains dozens of nude women <i>lounging</i> amongst creatures as if unaware of the impending danger. #InkGallery: Chimera
        ** [Zoom into the center.]
        Your eyes dart toward the center where you spot a woman confidently riding on a winged chimera in complete control of her destiny. Her gusto rubs off on you{B: and, somehow, all the fear immediately exits your body}.
        <- flyingBeasts
        ~fear--
        Still feeling {dream}, but now {fear}, you decide to turn your attention elsewhere. #InkGallery: Les Chimères leave_fear

        ** [Zoom into the bottom.]
        Your eyes dart toward the bottom where you spot a few women dreamily staring off into the distance. Although a serpent creeps among them, they remain calm.
        <- creepingBeasts
        ~fear--
        {
            - B:
                Now feeling {fear} and {dream}, you decide to turn your attention elsewhere. #InkGallery: Les Chimères leave_both
            - else:
                Still feeling {fear}, but now {dream}, you decide to turn your attention elsewhere. #InkGallery: Les Chimères leave_dream
        }
* (B) Why is it unfinished? #InkGallery: Chimera B
    Moreau abandoned the work shortly after his mother's passing to work on a much darker piece that dipicts the fact that DEATH is coming for us all.
