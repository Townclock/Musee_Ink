La Charmeuse de Serpents

You examine the painting:

The dark figure of a woman stares back at you, a snake coiled around her. Other snakes rise to her music. "What is the meaning of this painting? Am I Eve? Is my admirer a snake?" #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer

 * Who is this? #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer Eve
    It is Rousseau's Black Eve, mother of us all.
        ** Perhaps. Where is she? -> eden
        ** Is she meant to be alone?
            No, but she is tempting fate. -> banished
        ** But she's surrounded by snakes? How'd did that happen?
            -> banished
 * Where is she? #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer 
    This is the Garden of Eden. Eve has tasted the forbidden fruit, and knows good and evil.

        **Where is Adam?
            Adam has yet to be tempted. They remain in paradise, for now.
            ~themes += paradise
        **So what exactly did she do?
            -> banished
        
        ** (real)This is a bit too real.
            I don't think there are any knowledge here for me. 
            
 
 * (eden) Wait. If this is Eden, where is the tree of knowledge? #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer Trees
    ~themes += creation
    The snakes are tempted by her, not the other way around. Why?
    ** Do I <i>really</i> want to know more?
    -> banished
    ** Unlike Eve, I've gained no knowledge here.
    -> real

Once Eve has tasted knowledge, and shared it with Adam, they are banished from paradise. She is sentenced to a life of sorrow and hardship in childbirth. #InkGallery: SnakeCharmer Eve
