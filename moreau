 *{ time >= 30 and time <= 90}[A photographer. . .]
    The photographer has set up a couple of standing direction lamps and a tripod. In soft but deliberate motions she is adjusting their heights and angles. It's hard to see the piece she is framing.
    "Hey don't be shy. If you're interested come look closer." She invites.
    You move closer and see the piece she is taking a photo of.

    It is The Chimeras.
